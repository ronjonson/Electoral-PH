    <div class="row-md ">This website shows a representative map and results of the Philippines during each Presidential and Vice-Presidential Election if it adopted the US Electoral College</div>
    <div class="row-md ">Each year is divided into the Presidential and Vice-Presidential Elections.</div>
    <br>
    <div class="row-md fs-4 fw-bold">How the Electoral College Works</div>
    <div class="row-md">The Electoral College is the system used in the United States of America to elect their President</div>
    <div class="row-md">According <a href="https://www.usa.gov/electoral-college">usa.gov's</a> page on the electoral college</div>
    <div class="row-md">the President and Vice-President are elected through electors. Each state gets as many electors as it has members of congress</div>
    <div class="row-md">The winner of the popular vote for each state gets all the electors assigned to it.</div>
    <div class="row-md">For Example, if the winner of a certain state wins the popular vote by 40%, they will still get 100% of the electors for that certain state</div>
    <div class="row-md">To win the electoral college, you have to win at least 50% of the number of electors</div><br>
    <div class="row-md">In the Philippines, the number of representatives changes year by year, so the number of electors will change too</div>
    <div class="row-md">In this case, I have assumed that each Province and Independent City each get their own electors which amount to the number of Representatives they send to the Batasang Pambansa</div>
    <div class="row-md">I have also only counted the district representatives and not party list representatives as they dont representate any specific locale</div>
    <div class="row-md">The Senate has also been disregarded in the counting due to the fact that the Senate does not represent any specific area</div>
    <div class="row-md">Independent cities and Highly Urbanized Cities, (who have their own representatives) are administered separately from the province they are found in and therefore considered a separate 'state' in this map</div>
    <div class="row-md">Some Independent cities do not have their own representatives (such as Angeles City) and therefore were not separated from their province in this case</div>
</div>

    <div class="row">The election data has all come from wikipedia, if anyone knows where to find the official election data for each year let me know!</div>
